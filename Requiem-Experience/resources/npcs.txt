## Way to aggregate levels
Mode: Mean

## NPC EditorIDs ignore list
Ignore: .*3DNPC.*      ;levels of 3DNPC entities are just random
Ignore: callenhorker   ;level is out of place
Ignore: IDB_Actor_.*   ;some high-level crab
Ignore: RWT_SirCrabalot;unique high-level crab... wish it had separate race
Ignore: DLC2Miraak.*   ;his human form spoils humanoids
Ignore: zzzCHMemory.*  ;VIGILANT is not really balanced for Requiem
Ignore: Summon.*       ;levels of summonned entities shouldn't affect wild XP

## Race prefixes which must be grouped up to avoid racism, e.g. XP will be even
Groups: Atronachs = AtronachFrost,AtronachStorm,AtronachFlame
Groups: StopRacism = Argonian,Breton,DarkElf,HighElf,Imperial,Khajiit,Nord,Orc,Redguard,WoodElf

## Overrides for particular race EditorIDs
Override: DLC2MiraakRace = 250 ; He is tougher than he looks
Override: FoxRace = 1          ; Fox race is being abused by quest entities
Override: ChickenRace = 1      ; Chicken as well
